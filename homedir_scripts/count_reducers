# New method. Not perfect as two reducers with the same number from different workdirs will count as one
# Did not always work correctly? Reverted to old grep approach ftm

# New method, old grep approach (improved by 'bash -c ./reducer' grep above)
# Note the grep -v grep is necessary as for example ~/pr greps from reducer files and reducerx.sh will appear in ps output for those scripts, whereas they are not running reducers
