# Not perfect as reducers may have already finished, but with ~/ds it's quite accurate almost always

# New method. Not perfect as two reducers with the same number from different workdirs will count as one
# Did not always work correctly?
# ps -ef | grep -E 'bash -c ./reducer[0-9]\+\.sh|bash -c ./newbug_[0-9]+\.reducer' | grep -oE 'reducer[0-9]+\.sh|newbug_[0-9]+\.reducer.sh' | sort -u | wc -l

# New method, old grep approach (improved by 'bash -c ./reducer' grep above)
# Note the grep -v grep is necessary as for example ~/pr greps from reducer files and reducerx.sh will appear in ps output for those scripts, whereas they are not running reducers
# This does not work correctly, it misses them (newbug reducers), or counts too many (screen sessions with finished reducers)
#ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep -o 'reducer[0-9]\+\.sh' | sort -u | wc -l

# Old method
#COUNT1=$(ps -ef | grep --binary-files=text 'SCREEN' | grep --binary-files=text 'reducer[0-9]\+.sh' | sed 's|.*reducer|reducer|;s|;bash||' | sort -u | wc -l)
#COUNT2=$(screen -d -r | grep "\.reducer" | sort -u | wc -l)

# Incorrect (only counts screens, not truly active reducers)
