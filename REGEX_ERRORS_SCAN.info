* 'DATA TUPLE' was removed as a scan string, as InnoDB will show DATA TUPLE in situations were there is no error. For example creating a table referencing (via FK) a non-existing table while foreign_key_checks=0 is set, then turning this setting back on (=1), and subsequently/consequently running into a 'the required table/ibd file/index does not exist' together with a DATA TUPLE record when the table is accessed. Displaying the DATA TUPLE when such things happen is legacy/historical InnoDB behavior.
* '[ERROR] InnoDB' in test as of 10/10/22 - it may be too verbose
