  # TODO: WIP: This help text is not correct. Seems to be an issue with minimal grammars, however some fuzzers seem to work
  # Start server instance first. Currently there is a small race bug in afl-fuzz.c versus this script somewhere that if the 
  # Squirrel/AFL instance is started first insteaed, depending on the timing of things, the Squirrel/AFL will report a '#1' 
  # connection error to the log, and never find the instrumentation link with the server. Restarting the server later, when 
  # this original #1 issue does not happen, seems fine though (including subsequent #1 errors). This issue seems to be 
  # especially present/seen with very small grammars, which almost surely means that a faster startup of Squirrel/AFL will
  # lead to the issue seen. IOW, if the MariaDB server is not there on the very startup of AFL, an issue #1 will be output
  # with no further success. This is also visible in the AFL client where the new paths found (second output line) will
  # always read "none yet (odd..." and the counter at the top right will be green and looping quickly.
  # As a workaround for the time being (and maybe a good permanent solution), the MariaDB server is started first and then
  # there is a 3 second delay after which AFL is started. This 3 second delay may not even be required.
