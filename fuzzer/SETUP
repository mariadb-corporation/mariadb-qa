Welcome to MariaDB QA's (mariadb-qa) implementation of the Squirrel fuzzer setup procedure

Pre-Requisites: 
  * At least 64GB of ram, 95GB+ is better, and 128GB is recommended. SSD Recommended. 20+ Threads recommended.
  * Ubuntu 20.04 (or newer) or potentially Ubuntu 18.04 (ref 'Setup server' notes below)
  * Do not use RHEL/Centos or other operating systems; libs will not match and pre-compiled binaries will not work
  * Use a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04 and do not install (or uninstall) any MariaDB, MySQL, Percona servers

Note: *ALL* steps below are required. If you skip a single step, things will fail. Backtrack if you missed something

= Clone mariadb-qa
  # Note that it is necessary to clone mariadb-qa to your home (cd ~) directory. Many references are made to it in the code
  cd ~
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-qa.git
  cd ~/mariadb-qa

= Setup password-less sudo (for the user account which is used in combination with the framework)
  # Setting up and troubleshooting this is outside of scope of this guide. The instructions below are given as a guide only
  sudo visudo
  # Add this line:
  %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
  # Save and exit, and add your UserID to the sudo group:
  adduser $(whoami) sudo  # Note that this assumes 
  # Open a *completely new terminal session* and ensure the following command does not request a password:
  sudo ls  # If you are prompted for a password, the password-less sudo setup failed. Check sudo visudo and research online

= Run linkit to setup required directory, symlinks etc.
  # * Note that this will create many scripts in your home dir, create /data and /test on the server, etc.
  # * Create an additional UserID, login with the same, and restart the setup if you would like to keep things 'extra clean'
  #   On a dedicated testing server (best), creating a seperate UserID is generally not required nor desired
  ./linkit

= Setup server: Please read the precautionary WARNING notes below first
  # * This script will make many changes to the operating system settings, installed packages etc. of your system
  # * Alike to other softwares which require the absolute maximum out of all available hardware and the operating system,
  #   some of the changes made by this script WILL affect the security of the system; ensure the server is firewalled etc.
  # * Whilst this script was build for running outright, even senior engineers using this framework will manually
  #   copy and paste the various steps from this script and execute them at the command line to 'reason through things', 
  #   see the output, make any fixes if there are issues, etc. It is highly recommended you do not run this script outright
  #   Furthermore, if you are not using Ubuntu 20.04, changes wil be required. Ubuntu 18.04 instructions are included inside
  #   the script. Other operating systems like RHEL/Centos will be significantly more complex in almost every way, and 
  #   pre-compiled binaries will NOT run. A succesful setup on Ubuntu 20 (or 18) will take a few hours. Expect other
  #   operating systems to take ~1 week or more, as you would have to find all matching libraries, recompile binaries etc.
# ./setup_server.sh  # Read notes above. This line is disabled for precautionary reasons, but the setup is required.
  # Now setup a swapfile and especially tmpfs as indicated towards the end of the script
  # Make sure to adjust/scale the tmpfs (/dev/shm) size to your actual memory size (ref htop or 'total Mem' in free -g)

= Clone AFL++ (note that Squirrel at mariadb-qa/squirrel also has it's own AFL, but we will use AFL++ to instrument MariaDB)
  cd ~
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus.git AFL
  cd AFL

= Setup Clang 14 build environment
  # Note that both Clang (and AFL++) are in constant flux, and these instructions can change on a monthly basis
  # Note we use version 14 (AFL++ is not compatible yet with 15; SanitizerCoveragePCGUARD.so will fail to build)
  sudo apt -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
  # If any of the following clang-x items fail in the next line with E/Error, remove the corresponding items from the list
  sudo apt -y purge clang clang-10 clang-12 clang-14 clang-15 
  sudo wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
  # The next line installs LLVM 14 and includes Clang 14, libc++ etc. -
  sudo bash llvm.sh 14
  sudo apt -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
  sudo apt -y install gdb bison flex git make cmake build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib xinetd libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libncurses5-dev clang-14 liblld-14 liblldb-14 liblld-14-dev vim tmux python3-pip llvm llvm-dev llvm-runtime libmysqlclient-dev
  # In the next line, we want to install gcc-9-plugin-dev - or any other version (like -9-) relevant to your GCC
  # You can find out the version using gcc --version  
  sudo apt install gcc-$(gcc --version | grep -o 'Ubuntu [0-9]\+' | grep -o '[0-9]\+$' | head -n1)-plugin-dev
  pip install libtmux
  sudo reboot

= Compile AFL++ using Clang 14
  # The next line is very imporatnt, and ensures a sufficiently large MAP SIZE
  sed -i 's/#define[ \t]\+MAP_SIZE_POW2[ \t]\+[12][0-9]/#define MAP_SIZE_POW2 22/' config.h
  export CC=/usr/bin/clang-14
  export CXX=/usr/bin/clang-cpp-14
  export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-14
  which clang-14        # Check output is /usr/bin/clang-14
  which clang-cpp-14    # Check output is /usr/bin/clang-cpp-14
  which llvm-config-14  # Check output is /usr/bin/llvm-config-14
  /usr/bin/llvm-config-14 --version  # Check output is 14.0.0 or later (likely 14.0.6 or later on Ubuntu 20.04)
  make -j20  # If any issues, try make without the parallelization to see the output/error (look for Error / red items)

= Build MariaDB server: optimized binaries, debug binaries
  # Note: it is recommended to do three builds: an optimized (no debug symbols) version of MariaDB, a debug (debug symbols
  # and asserts included) build and an instrumented build, all of the same version of MariaDB. This will allow other tools
  # (ref PROCEDURE) to automatically test testcases, reduce their complexity etc. against non-instrumented builds whilst
  # running mariadb-qa's version of Squirrel. Here we will first build the optimized and debug binaries
  cd /test  # If this script is not available, you did not correctly run ~/mariadb-qa/linkit
  ./clone.sh 10.8  # For MariaDB 10.8. Note clone.sh is a background script. You will need to wait till the process completes
  cd 10.8
  # The following command will build an optimized and debug build of MariaDB server (or MySQL or Percona server)
  # Do not modify the sleep (the minimum is sleep 90 on a fast server) to avoid tarball/directory naming conflicts
  ~/mariadb-qa/build_mdpsms_opt.sh & sleep 180; ~/mariadb-qa/build_mdpsms_dbg.sh  # Background, wait for these to finish
  cd /test
  ls -ld MD*  # This will show you the just-created builds and their tarballs, i.e. MD290122-mariadb-10.8.1-linux-x86_64-dbg
  cd MD290122-mariadb-10.8.1-linux-x86_64-dbg  # Change the name as required (note the format is MDddmmyy
  # The ~/start script creates a whole set of handy scripts in the current BASEDIR you are in
  ~/start  # If this script is not available, you did not correctly run ~/mariadb-qa/linkit
  # The ./all script (created by ~/start) creates a fresh data directory, starts the MariaDB server and brings up the client
  ./all  # If this script is not available, something went amiss with running ~/start or the server (this should not happen)
  # This should have brought you to the command line interface (CLI) of the MariaDB server. You should be able to do at least:
  10.8.4-dbg>SELECT 1\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
  1: 1
  1 row in set (0.000 sec)
  10.8.4-dbg>exit;
  # Once back that the Linux terminal prompt, issue ./stop to stop the MariaDB server
  ./stop
  # Repeat the same steps for the alternate installation (i.e. MD290122-mariadb-10.8.1-linux-x86_64-opt with 'opt' instead of
  # 'dbg' in the example, and vice versa if you did opt first) to ~/start and ./all ("test") the alternate installation
  # Congratulations, if you made it thus far, you created a non-instrumented optimized and debug build of MariaDB server
  # Note that these instances of MariaDB are all contained within BASEDIR directories - they are not installed using atp etc.
  # This is of great advantage when wanting to bring up many instances etc.

= Build MariaDB server: instrumented binaries (debug + optimized)
  # Note: it is very important for Squirrel/AFL that instrumentation is working correctly. There is very little (read: no)
  # point in running Squirrel/AFL with an uninstrumented binary, as Squirrel/AFL will not be able able to "see" what paths
  # it is triggering in the server. The way that instrumentation works is as follows: when the database server is started,
  # the instrumentation code starts as well. Then, both the database server as well as Squirrel will use a shared memory
  # space (ref SHM_ENV_VAR in the scripts) which passes information to Squirrel to let it know what code paths are being hit
  cd /test
  cp -r 10.8 10.8_instrumented
  cd 10.8_instrumented
  export CC=${HOME}/AFL/afl-clang-fast     # export CC=${HOME}/squirrel/AFLplusplus/afl-clang-fast   # For new Squirrel release

= Getting ready to fuzz: preliminary tests
  # Setup some directories
  cd ~/fuzzing
  ls -l afl0-fuzz afl start_fuzzing  # This should show 3 symlinks to ${HOME}/fuzzer scripts. Run ~/mariadb-qa/linkit if not
  # If you see any issues with the following command, for example missing libraries, then there either is a package 
  # missing on your system (which is unlikely if you followed this guide and actioned setup_server.sh and all other
  # steps above), or you are trying to use an Ubuntu-compiled binary on a non-compatible operating system like RHEL or Centos
  # You can recompile afl0-fuzz (and it's sister binaries afl1-fuzz to afl9-fuzz) by recompiling afl-fuzz.c which is located
  # ~/mariadb-qa/squirrel/MariaDB/AFL/afl-fuzz.c, however you will need to change the socket inside the script from 0 to 9
  # (/test/afl0_socket.sock) to build the corresponding binaries. You should also be careful to be compiling this with 
  # Clang 14 (and *not* with the AFL-instrumented builder in ~/AFL). IOW, export CC=/usr/bin/clang-14 etc. i.e. similar to 
  # the steps shown in 'Compile AFL++ using Clang 14' above. This is also the method to recompile all afl0-fuzz to afl9-fuzz
  # binaries if changes are made in the script. Future versions of the binary may accept command line options for the socket
  ./afl0-fuzz  # This should not give any errors and output a list of options. 
  # In the following step, update the BASEDIR to the directory of the *instrumented* build created in the last step, i.e.
  # BASEDIR=/test/AFL-MDddmmyy-mariadb-10.8.1-linux-x86_64-dbg  # or similar
  vi start_fuzzing
  # Edit the ./fuzzing_root/go script to set the SQL_PATH to a grammar present in fuzzing_root (try './input' which is 
  # automatically added by the linkit script). Read more about grammars here: https://github.com/s3team/Squirrel/issues/11
  vi ./fuzzing_root/go

= Start fuzzing
  ./start_fuzzing  # Wait for all screens to be created
  # In the output of the following command, you should (when all nodes are started) see 20 screens: afl0 to afl9 are the
  # 10 Squirrel/AFL fuzzing nodes. srv0-afl to srv9-afl are the database instances, with some relevant information
  ~/s  # This lists all screens
  # In the following screen, you should see 'last new path' being updated. If it continually says "none yet (odd...)" there
  # is some issue and the instrumentation between the server and the AFL fuzzing instance is not working correctlyt
  ~/s afl0  # This will bring you the AFL based overview of Squirrel fuzzing for node 0 (there are 10 nodes: 0-9)
  # From a secondary terminal session (or press CTRL+a+d to exit the screen you are currently in)
  ~/s srv0-afl  # This will bring you to a brief overview 

= Troubleshooting
  # The first action item is always to check the logs. The examples below are for node 0, change 0 to 1-9 for other nodes
  vi ./afl0.log  # This log outputs issues observed by Squirrel
  vi /dev/shm/log/master.err  # The mariadbd/mysql error log (the database server error log) for the given node
  # If you see 'shmat for map: Bad file descriptor' then there is an instumentation communication breakdown between the
  # MariaDB server instance and the Squirrel/AFL instance. Check that ./afl0-fuzz works and does not give an undefined 
  # symbol error. You can use ldd ./afl0-fuzz to check which symbol is missing.

= Further steps
  # If you made it this far, super congratulations; you now have 10 instances fuzzing MariaDB server! Now checkout the other
  # tools available to you by viewing the PROCEDURE file in this directory. Note that some scripts need to have variables
  # preset, just like was done above to configure start_fuzzing. You will also find more information inside the scripts
  vi PROCEDURE
