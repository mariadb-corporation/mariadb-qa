MariaDB QA
==================================================================================

MariaDB QA is a suite of scripts and utilities which assists in building,
automated testing & bug reporting for MariaDB products.

With thanks and gratitude to the team at Percona for the original work at:
https://github.com/Percona-QA/percona-qa

For a video introduction to some of the scripts, see:

Please Note: 
* For a number of the scripts to run successfully, it is required that sudo is enabled and working and should not request a password.
* Please contact Roel or Ramesh if you have questions/for information.
* Most of the documentation is in-line in the code
