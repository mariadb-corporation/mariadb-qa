MariaDB QA
==================================================================================

MariaDB QA is a suite of scripts and utilities which assists in building, fuzzing, automated testing and bug reporting for MariaDB products.

With thanks and gratitude to the team at Percona for the original work at:

For a video introduction to PQuery and a number of the PQuery Framework scripts, see:

For a start guide to the Framework (PQuery + MariaDB's implementation of the Squirrel Fuzzer), see:

Please Note: 
* For a number of the scripts to run successfully, it is required that sudo is enabled and working and should not request a password.
* Please contact Roel or Ramesh (see commits) if you have questions, or for information.
* Most of the documentation is in-line in the code.
