# This helper script is sourced by other scripts (~/ds, ~/memory homedir scripts and mariadb-build-qa/terminate_long_running.sh), and thereby avoids code duplication in those scripts. As it is sourced rather than executed, it does not need +x
# TODO: may need xargs? (only add if proven to be needed as filter)
