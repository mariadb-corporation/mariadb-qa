# Discussed RS/RV 19-02-2021
# Whereas the command above ^ is the most accurate (and should be maintained alike to the line below!), the
# line below adds an additional drop of the specific node selector `-1,-2,-3` in order - FOR THE MOMENT (TODO) -
# to delete the entire trial. Once we commence pquery multinode runs, we should start using the line above instead,
# Or make the line optional or selectable somehow. Perhaps we can have another homedir script which selects either
# line etc. One more questionable item is the '*' in the 's|\-[1-3]*$||' sed (it's too broad, there for -23 TODO)
# Can it be removed later on without limiting cleanup functionality? TEST.
